        <p> I am currently in the process of shifting careers from my previous field of Mechanical Engineering into 
            career in coding.  I graduated from the University of St. Thomas, in St. Paul, Minnesota, in the spring of 
            2018.  Following graduation, I worked as a medical device manufacturing engineer at Boston Scientific.  In the fall of 2020, I 
            switched jobs, joining Emerson as an Inside Sales engineer.
        </p>
        <br>        
        <p>I am currently enrolled in the web development coding bootcamp through the University of Minnesota.  I am hoping
            to leverage the knowledge gained in this bootcamp to help transition into the web development career field.  I believe
            this will allow me to use a combination of problem solving, and logic to help find effective solutions in the 
            workplace.
